# Introduction

Welcome to my personal wiki and blog! This site is a collection of notes, thoughts, and projects that I've been working on. Feel free to explore!

## Sections

There is a blog section where I document the creation of this blog and other projects.

- [Journal](/posts/_index.md)

Here's the main documentation section.

- [Docs](docs/_index.md)

  - [Help](docs/help/_index.md) - This is where I document some fixes / workarounds for issues I've encountered.

  - [Cool](docs/cool_stuff/_index.md) - This is stuff I think is neat
